========

Differential Evolution (DE) optimization algorithms perform satisfactorily even on complex problems in higher dimensionality. However, it is difficult to *a priori* choose optimal parameters.
In this package, we propose **DElo** (DE with adaptation based on Elo rating system). Elo rating, originally used in chess, is a way to measure dynamic fitness.
