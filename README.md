## Overview
Differential Evolution (DE) optimization algorithms perform satisfactorily even on complex problems in higher dimensionality. However, it is difficult to *a priori* choose optimal parameters.
In this package, we propose **DElo** (DE with adaptation based on Elo rating system). Elo rating, originally used in chess, is a way to measure dynamic fitness.

## Installation
Navigate to repository root folder and execute command
```
pip install -e .
```
That installs a **developer** version - any changes to files in package source will immediately take effect. No reintalls required.

To install a **regular** version, just execute without `-e` option.

## ELO system for chess explained:

The general idea is when comparing two solutions/genomes/specimens. If one has a better score do not consider it better, but rather it will be the one with a bigger probability of being better.

It is based on <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S(f(x_1)-f(x_2))"> where S is sigmoid function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S(y) = \frac{1}{1 %2B e^{-y}}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f"> is score function, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x_i"> being i-th specimen.
